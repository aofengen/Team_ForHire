## Deploying this website

Ensure you have [Firebase Tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) installed globally on your system. Deploy to Firebase - [this is a good tutorial](https://alligator.io/angular/deploying-angular-app-to-firebase/). The relevant commands are:

    -`ng build`
    -`firebase init`
        -You will have to login with your Firebase credentials, and choose/create a Firebase project
        -Choose the Hosting option
        -When it asks about the public, enter dist instead
    -Edit the firebase.json file to include the '*rewrites*' section:
        - ``` {
            {
            "hosting": {
                "public": "dist",
                "ignore": [
                "firebase.json",
                "**/.*",
                "**/node_modules/**"
                ],
                "rewrites": [
                {
                    "source": "/dist/**",
                    "destination": "/index.html"
                },
                {
                    "source": "**",
                    "destination": "/index.html"
                }
                ]
            }
            }
 - `firebase deploy`
